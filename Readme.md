# Webpages for Humans

Webpages for Humans is a web application that creates a version of the
Internet which is only readable by humans. Web pages are "CAPTCHA-fied" 
through a proxy to create a distorted and 
manipulated rendering of that webpage. This previously machine-readable 
text, is distorted using the same algorithms used in CAPTCHA tests to 
ensure the computer programs can no longer decipher them as text using 
Optical Character Recognition technologies.
